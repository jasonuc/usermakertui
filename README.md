## **Getting Started**

### **Installation & Usage**

`usermakertui` demonstrates how to build a real-time form in the terminal. It comes with a sample application that shows a user creation form, but you can modify it for other use cases.

1. Clone and build:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jasonuc/usermakertui.git
    cd usermakertui
    go build -o usermaker
    ```

2. Run the example form:

    ```bash
    ./usermaker
    ```

### **How It Works**

`usermakertui` leverages the power of [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) to create a form that **validates inputs in real-time**. Users get immediate feedback as they type, with errors highlighted and suggestions displayed dynamically. The example provided shows how you can create a form for user input (e.g., email, password), but the concept can be extended to any kind of terminal-based form.

### **Customization**

Want to adapt the real-time form for your own needs? Here‚Äôs how you can customize it:

- **Add or Modify Input Fields**: Add new `textinput.Model` components for different types of data.
- **Change Styles**: Easily tweak the styling using [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) to match your brand or aesthetic.
- **Use for Different Applications**: Integrate this form concept into other Bubble Tea-based TUIs, like setup wizards, data entry tools, or interactive scripts.

### **Why Real-Time Feedback in TUIs?**

The real power of `usermakertui` is showing how **real-time feedback** can transform the user experience in terminal applications. By giving users immediate validation, error handling, and visual cues, you can make your TUIs as intuitive and user-friendly as modern graphical apps.
